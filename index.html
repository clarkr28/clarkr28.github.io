            <h2>Graduation Synopsis</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              I'll get this out of the way right now, as it seems to be the first question everyone is asking me lately.  No, I'm not done with college yet.  I'll finish my undergraduate degree in computer science in December of 2018, which means it took me 4.5 years to complete.  However, I'm going to continue at MSU to earn a master's degree in computer science immediately thereafter.  I'll be done with that in May of 2020.  To review, I'll walk across the graduation stage in December 2018 for my undergraduate degree, and I will promptly turn around and proceed to the engineering building for another three semesters.
            </p>
            <h2>My life at MSU</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              For my first three years of college, I was on the MSU Drumline.  Deciding to audition for the drumline
              was easily the best decision I have made in college.  Even though I spent 12.5 hours a week
              in rehearsal and every gameday took 12 hours from my weekend, I made more memories
              and friends than I thought possible.  Even though I am no longer on the drumline,
              it still holds a special place to me.  The memories I made were worth every minute of rehearsal
              and practice.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              During my fourth year of college, I decided to take a position as
              a TA for our operating systems class.  I had more time now that I
              wasn't in marching band, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to interact with the CSE faculty and help students learn.  This year (fifth year), I started doing research with Dr. McKinley, a CSE professor, focused on the assurance of autonomous systems.  More information about this can be found under the <a class="normal" href="cse.html">CSE page</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              Aside from being a MSU Drumline alumnus, I enjoy hiking and swimming.  I
              recently took up SCUBA diving, and it's my new obsession.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is adventurous and likes the water.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
	            In terms of sports, I crave college basketball and football.  I don't believe there is any event more exciting than March Madness, and a love for football is a well-known byproduct of being in a marching band.
