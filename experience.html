        <h1>Experience</h1>

        <h2>Compuware</h2>
        <p class="normal-paragraph">
          In the summer of 2017, I worked for Compuware in downtown Detroit.  Compuware is a mainframe
          software company that provides software tools for other mainframe developers.  One of the biggest
          challenges that I faced was that I didn't know anything about mainframes before I started
          working at Compuware.  I worked with a team of other interns that had all taken mainframe courses
          at the universities they attended.  While I had to spend some time at the beginning of my
          internship solely learning about z/OS and the programming languages used on mainframes, it
          did not take me long to catch up with the abilities of my teammates.  What this internship
          really showed me is that I can learn any new technology that comes my way, and I should never be
          afraid of the unknown when diving into a new project.

        <h2>AK Steel</h2>
        <p class="normal-paragraph">
          In the summer of 2016, I was a process control intern at AK Steel's Dearborn Work's plant.  The
        	process control department is responsible for monitoring the plant and keeping track of the
          products moving through the steel making process.  And
        	when you have a fully integrated steel mill that produces 16,000,000 pounds of
        	steel every day, you better believe there is a lot going on.  While I was there I spent
        	most of my time making a desktop application to store and maintain the necking data
        	for AK's hot strip mill, PLTCM, and cold mill.  I also made a few webpages on one of
        	their internal websites that generated custom reports about material consumption during
        	the steel making process.

        <h2>Fraunhofer USA</h2>
        <p class="normal-paragraph">
          Fraunhofer USA is a research company that has a branch located on MSU's campus.  Our location
        	is Fraunhofer's Center for Coatings and Diamond Technologies (CCD).  For my first few
        	years there, I worked mostly on our machines for diamond research.  I was responsible for
        	maintaining and upgrading all of the software on these completely automated machines.
        	During the fall of 2016, I transitioned to creating an Android application for
        	a new product we are developing.  Fraunhofer was my job on campus until I decided to take
          a position as a TA in the fall of 2017.
