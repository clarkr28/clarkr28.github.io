        <h1>Experience</h1>

        <h2>AK Steel</h2>
        <p class="normal-paragraph">
          In the summer of 2016, I was a process control intern at AK Steel's Dearborn Work's plant.  The
        	process control department is responsible for exactly that - process controls.  And
        	when you have a fully integrated steel mill that produces 16,000,000 pounds of
        	steel every day, you better believe there is a lot going on.  While I was there I spent
        	most of my time making a desktop application to store and maintain the necking data
        	for AK's hot strip mill, PLTCM, and cold mill.  I also made a few webpages on one of
        	their internal websites that generated custom reports about material consumption during
        	the steel making process.

        <h2>Fraunhofer USA</h2>
        <p class="normal-paragraph">
          Fraunhofer USA is a research company that has a branch located at MSU.  Our location
        	is Fraunhofer's Center for Coatings and Diamond Technologies (CCD).  For my first few
        	years there, I worked mostly on our machines for diamond research.  I was responsible for
        	maintaining and upgrading all of the software on these completely automated machines.
        	Since the fall of 2016, I have transitioned to creating an android application for
        	a new product we are developing.  Although I worked at AK Steel in the summer of 2016,
          I have continued to work for Fraunhofer during my semesters at Michigan State.
