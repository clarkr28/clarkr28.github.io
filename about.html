            <h2>My life at MSU</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              For the past three years, I was on the MSU Drumline.  Deciding to audition for the drumline
              was easily the best decision I have made in college.  Even though I spent 12.5 hours a week
              in rehearsal and every Saturday was spent in marching band mode, I've made more memories
              and friends than I thought possible.  This year I decided not to return to the drumline so I
              can enjoy my time on campus while I still have it.  Even though I am no longer on the drumline,
              it still holds a special place to me.  The memories I made were worth every minute of rehearsal
              and practice.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              Now that I have more time on my hands, I decided to be a TA for our operating systems class.  MSU
              is fortunate to have a great set of Computer Science faculty, and I have enjoyed working
              with them so far.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              Aside from being a MSU Drumline alumnus (AKA dead battery), I enjoy hiking and swimming.  I'm
              currently enrolled in a SCUBA class at MSU, and I'm hoping to go diving to some of the shipwricks
              in the Great Lakes once I am certified.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
	            I love the Red Wings, and I love hockey.  As a matter of fact, I have a Red Wings game
	            on right now.  I don't mind watching almost any sport, but nothing
	            keeps me on the edge of my seat like a good hockey game.
