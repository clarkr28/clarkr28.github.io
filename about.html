            <h2>My life at MSU</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              One word - busy.  On top of taking computer science courses and everything
	            else required by Michigan State, I'm on the MSU Drumline.  That
	            means I have 12.5 hours of rehearsal every week besides memorizing all the music
	            on my own time.  And don't forget about football games, which easily take up 10 hours
	            of your Saturday.  So I'm busy.  Even though marching band makes my fall semesters
	            a little hectic, I have countless memories that I wouldn't have made without it.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
              Aside from being on the drumline, I really enjoy mountain biking on some of Michigan's
	            great trails.  I'm no pro, but I love to spend some time kicking up some dirt.  Some of
	            my best summer memories are riding cross country ski trails at some of Michigan's ski
	            resorts.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
	            I love the Red Wings, and I love hockey.  As a matter of fact, I have a Red Wings game
	            on right now.  I don't mind watching almost any sport, but nothing
	            keeps me on the edge of my seat like a good hockey game.
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
	            As much as I like hockey, there is a special place in my heart for Spartan Football.  It's
	            nearly impossible to be a member of the Spartan Marching Band and not have a burning
	            passion for your team and your university.
