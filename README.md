Hello!  Welcome to my personal website repository.

My goal for this website was to provide prospective employers with a way to learn
more about me and get a better understanding of who I am.  Five minutes of conversation
at a career fair will only go so far, especially when employers are trying to filter
through an infinite line of candidates.  I wanted to give a prospective employer more
insight about me, and this was my solution.  My intention was
not to wow anyone with any web dev genius - I merely wanted a website that was well
organized, informative, and borderline attractive.   With all of this in mind,
feel free to wander its contents to your heart's desire.
