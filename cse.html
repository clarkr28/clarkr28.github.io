            Before I was in college, I wanted to know how computers worked.  I had no idea how a
  	        computer could open a document or a phone could send a text.  Those were the kinds of
  	        things that really made me curious.  That made my decision to study computer science
            rather straightforward.  The more courses I have taken,
          	the more I've enjoyed learning how these devices actually work.  Every class
            has shed more light on the "magic" of how computers work, which keeps motivated and
            engaged in my classes.  Being a computer science student has shown me how much I love
            to learn, which is something I hope to do for the rest of my career.

        <h2>ARM Programming</h2>

            My favorite class so far has been my computer architecture class.  In that class, we learned
            about how computers actually work down to the hardware level.  What made this class my favorite
            was that there was no more "magic" about how computers work.  It also introduced me to
            programming in assembly.  Our class focused on the ARM architecture, and we had to learn how
            to program in ARM assembly.  Even though writing a program in assembly took me
            longer than writing the same program in C, I was facinated by the challenges that programming in
            assembly presented.  I was so curious about assembly that I began to work on some of my own
            projects in assembly - feel free to take a look at some of my code that I uploaded to GitHub
            (account: clarkr28).
