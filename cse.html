            Before I was in college, I wanted to know how computers worked.  I had no idea how a
  	        computer could open a document or a phone could send a text.  Those are the kinds of
  	        things that really made me think.  Now that I've been through a few years of college,
          	I've realized that there is so much more going on than I could have imagined.  That's
          	what I love about computer science - it's everywhere.  Not only is it everywhere, but
          	it has totally changed the way our world operates.  I can't think of any field that is
          	as universal and promising as computer science is right now.

            Recently, I have been learning Java and Android development.  One of
            other great things about computer science that I have come to appreciate is being a part
            of a community that encourages others to dive into new technologies.  As a result, there
            are tons of resources available to help people learn and understand almost anything.
