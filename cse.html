            Before I was in college, I wanted to know how computers worked.  I had no idea how a
  	        computer could open a document or a phone could send a text.  Those were the kinds of
  	        things that really made me think.  The more computer science courses I have taken,
          	the more I've realized that there is so much more going on than I could have imagined.  That's
          	what I love about computer science - it's everywhere.  Not only is it everywhere, but
          	it has totally changed the way our world works.  I can't think of any other field that has
          	had as much of an impact on our world as computer science.  I can be a part of changing our
            world, and that's why I love computer science.

            Recently, I have been learning Java/Android development.  One of the
            other great things about computer science that I have come to appreciate is being a part
            of a community that encourages others to dive into new technologies.  If I don't know how
            to do sometthing, that just means I get to learn how to do something.
            I am extremely curious, and I love to learn.  There
            are tons of resources at my fingertips to help me understand almost anything.
            Right now, that's Android development.  I can't wait to find out what it will be tomorrow.
