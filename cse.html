            This fall (2018), I started doing research with a computer science
            group at MSU focused on
            the assurance of autonomous systems.  While many research groups
            are focused on developing autonomous systems, our focus is on how
            to test these systems to learn more about the limits of their
            capabilities.  By being able to disciver the limits of a system
            and how its performance degrades as it reaches these limits,
            developers of these systems will be better equipped to make them
            more robust and reliable.  My work involves using ROS to program
            our robots, Gazebo to simulate them, and genetic algorithms do
            discover limitations of their capabilities.

            Like most computer science students, I find AI to be very interesting -
            no surprise there.  Quite honestly, it's one of the biggest reasons
            why I decided to pursue a master's degree.  I have the privilege of
            taking dedicated courses in machine learning, computer vision, data
            science, deep learning, pattern recognition, and other fascinating
            topics that aren't under the AI umbrella.  My research has me very
            interested in how robotics companies are using AI to develop more
            capable robots.  I'm also interested in learning about how
            companies with large amounts of data are using artificial
            intelligence to their advantage.

            One of my undergraduate courses that I found most interesting was
            my computer architecture
            class.  In that class, we learned about how computers actually work
            down to the hardware level.  What made this class so interesting to
            me was that there was no more "magic" about how computers work.  It
            also introduced me to programming in assembly - our class focused
            on the ARM architecture.  Even though writing a program in assembly
            took me longer than writing the same program in C, I was facinated
            by the challenges that programming in assembly presented.
